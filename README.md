# CV
My academic CV, along with the `tex` source file.

The template is borrowed from Brian Buccola, who you should check out
[here](https://github.com/brianbuccola).

The Python script `find-citation-counts.py` counts citations from Google Scholar
excluding self-citations (using the
[`scholarly`](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly) package).
It can take a bit of time to run.
